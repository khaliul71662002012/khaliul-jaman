## Introduction

Bangladesh is undergoing rapid digital transformation, unlocking significant opportunities in economic growth, innovation, and governance. However, this digital progress also exposes the nation to a range of cybersecurity challenges including data breaches, financial fraud, cyberterrorism, and digital surveillance concerns. While foundational laws such as the *ICT Act (2006)* and *Digital Security Act (2018)* have been introduced, substantial reform is needed to align with global best practices and uphold digital rights.
